# About Me
I look to live in a world where software can do anything, while being accessible to everyone.
Most of my projects are written in C#, being my primary language, others being C, web, nodeJS, and a few others.
Everything I make is free to use, as long as you do not claim it as your own, and I highly encourage contributing!
