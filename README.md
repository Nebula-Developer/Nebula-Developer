# About Me
I look to live in a world where software can do anything, while being free and accessible to everyone.

My site, [NebulaDev](https://nebuladev.net) holds all of my project's download links, information, and behind the scenes stuff that I am sure you will like.

# Contact
Wanna say something? You can message me here: <contact@nebuladev.net>

(I use two emails just so I can easily sort everything..)
