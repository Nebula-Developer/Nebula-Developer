# Hello There.
I'm **Nebula-Dev**, a young New Zealand programmer that specializes mainly in *C#*, but also web design as of *HTML, CSS,* and *JavaScript.*
I am also a passionate musician, playing guitar, drums, and computer music. 

## My Projects:
My main project as of right now are two amazing C# libraries, Constructivity, being for generating random sentences with randomly made words, 
and Compassion, a fully working C# addon perfect for many uses.

And my soon-to-come page. More details on that soon.
